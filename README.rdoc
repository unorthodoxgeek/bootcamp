=== Welcome to bootcamp!
Bootcamp, not unlike the project which created Rails, is a project management system, built to get us to know Ruby and Rails.

== Important bits
We'll use a bunch of gems here.
* Twitter's bootstrap - unLESSified - https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass
* Devise - user management - https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
* CanCan - makes sure these users don't stick their noses in other users' business - https://github.com/ryanb/cancan
* pry - makes Ruby shell suck less - https://github.com/pry/pry
* FactoryGirl - makes faking stuff out in specs a breeze
* Faker - fakes strings for us
